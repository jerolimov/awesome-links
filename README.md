# Awesome links

Instead of referencing all these awesome-* projects here on GitHub with pure
links, this project includes many of them as git submodule.
So you can clone this repository and grep all of them together.

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/jerolimov/awesome-links.git

Grep them locally, offline, and with your preferred tools:

    grep -i alternative -r .

or

    grep -i auto.*layout -r awesome-ios awesome-swift

### Which projects are included, yet?

Checkout the [.gitmodules](https://github.com/jerolimov/awesome-links/blob/gh-pages/.gitmodules) file.
