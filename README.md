# Awesome links

Inspired by all these great `awesome-*` projects here on GitHub. Thanks to [@bayandin](https://github.com/bayandin)
who collect a big list in his [awesome-awesomeness](https://github.com/bayandin/awesome-awesomeness) project.

Instead of referencing all of them with good old links, I added them here as submodules. So you can clone this repository and then search in all of these READMEs. Local, offline and with your prefered tools:

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:jerolimov/awesome-links.git
cd awesome-links

grep -i alternative -r .
# or
grep -i log -r awesome-swift
```

*Common questions:*

Which projects are included, yet? Checkout `git submodule status` or the
[.gitmodules](https://github.com/jerolimov/awesome-links/blob/gh-pages/.gitmodules) files.

Would you add other repositories? Maybe, please open a PR :)
