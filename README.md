# Awesome links

Inspired by all these great `awesome-*` projects here on GitHub. Thanks to [@bayandin](https://github.com/bayandin)
who collect a big list in his [awesome-awesomeness](https://github.com/bayandin/awesome-awesomeness) project.

Instead of referencing all of them with a link, I added them as submodules here...

So you can clone this repository and grep all these readme locally.

	git clone --resurive git@github.com:bayandin/awesome-awesomeness.git

Which projects are included, yet? Checkout `git submodule status` or `cat .gitmodules`

Would you add other repositories? Maybe, please open a PR :)
